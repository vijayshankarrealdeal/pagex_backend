  "summary": "In this live broadcast of 'Vantage with Palki Sharma' by Firstpost, US President Donald Trump announces a new policy imposing a 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks, set to take effect next week. Trump argues that the move will boost domestic growth by encouraging companies to relocate production back to the United States, countering previous trends of offshoring to Mexico and Canada. The announcement has sparked significant international backlashâ€”the European Union condemned the decision, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called it a 'direct attack' on Canadian workers. The program also examines the potential impact of the tariffs on India, offering insights from an Indian perspective on global trade dynamics.",
